## Scrape REI.com ##

* In this module I scrape REI.com for products using BeautifulSoup, Selenium & regular expressions
* Scrape product information to populate a DynamoDB database


### WARNING  ###
* this webscraping seemed to upset REI.com's service policy, though I have no ill (or money making) intentions with the use of the data I have received from rei.com, My IP address has been banned from accessing their website (Before I was able to modify my scraper to get the product images).  My intention for accessing their product information was simply to have a database of products to use for my fake ecomerce platform.  None the less, certainly a valuable lesson!  
* This was alleviated by resetting internent which changed the IP
